// ONE TIME program to FIX missing deleted TEXT file ACTIVITIES
// DO NOT run this again - - saved as example of mongo terminal (JS) scripting
//
// this file needed because some textfile activities were lost when activities collection was replaced
//  run in MONGO SHELL with: load('scriptname')
//
